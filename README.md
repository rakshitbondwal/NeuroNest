NeuroNest is an AI-powered system for the early detection of neurological disorders like Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke. Leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, it analyzes eye movements, blinking patterns, and voice characteristics to assess potential risks—all using accessible inputs from standard webcams and microphones.

---> 🚀 Features : 
🔍 Eye Blink & Movement Analysis using MRL Eye Dataset and CNN
🎙️ Voice Feature Analysis using Parkinson's Speech Dataset

--->🧠 Focused on early detection of :
Parkinson’s Disease
Alzheimer’s Disease (scope for extension)
Stroke

--->📦 Real-time Inference Capabilities
--->🧪 Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

--->📁 Datasets Used : 
1. MRL Eye Dataset
For detecting eye states (open/closed) to infer fatigue or abnormal blink patterns.
